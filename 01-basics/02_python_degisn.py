# The classical "Hello World" example is mentioned below for the illustration purpose:
print("Hello World")

# let's explore the syntax

#------------- declare variable in python 
# easy to write code
# easy to debug 
# easy to readable
# easy to understand
# easy to move into backhand-development
# well manner code 

#  Interactive Language - Python supports command line shell which provides output for each statement while keeping previously fed statements in active memory. A new line is sent to the interpreter which is evaluated both in part and in whole.
# Interpreted Language - Python is an interpreted language. It executes code line by line which enables easy debugging and learning.
# Integrated Language - Python can be easily integrated with other languages like C, C++ and JAVA etc.
# Open-Source Language - Python is an open source language which makes it freely usable and distributable, even for commercial use.
# Modular Language - Python allows user to logically organize python code in a file which can be further imported in another python code. This makes Python easy to learn and code.
# Dynamic Language - Python is a dynamic language. It allows user to change functions and objects at run-time.
# Object-Oriented Programming Language - Python supports object oriented programming.
# Portable Language - Python can be interpreted on various operating systems including UNIX-based systems, Mac OS and various versions of Windows.
# High-Level Language - Python is a high-level language and enables development of a program in user friendly way and generally independent of computerâ€™s hardware architecture.
# Extensible in C++ & C - Python can be used in C++ and C program which enables scripting capabilities for a programmer.
# Extensive Library Support - Python standard library is very huge. Along with this, it also supports third party library as well which enables fast programming.
